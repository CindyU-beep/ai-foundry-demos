    "Welcome to this interactive workshop on multi-agent AI systems! In this notebook, we'll explore how multiple AI agents can work together to write, edit, and fact-check a news article - similar to how a real newsroom operates.\n",

    "\n",
    "This demo showcases:\n",
    "1. ü§ñ **Multiple AI Agents** working together, each with a specific role\n",
    "2. üîç **Real-time fact checking** using Bing Search\n",
    "3. ‚úçÔ∏è **Iterative improvement** of content through collaboration\n",

    "### The Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Our system uses four specialized agents:\n",
    "- **Writer Agent** üìù - Creates and revises the article\n",
    "- **Editor Agent** üìã - Reviews and suggests improvements\n",
    "- **Verifier Agent** ‚úîÔ∏è - Fact-checks using Bing Search\n",
